        21:00:00","tz_id":null,"description":" <br> &quot;We&#39;re a Mexican American
        band, and no word describes America like immigrant. Most of usare children
        of immigrants, so it&#39;s perhaps natural that the songs we create celebrate
        America inthis way.&quot; So says Louie Perez, the &quot;poet laureate&quot;
        and primary wordsmith of Los Lobos, whendescribing the songs on the band&#39;s
        new album, Gates of Gold.The stories on Gates of Gold are snapshots of experiences
        that Perez and his band mates havehad, based on where they are emotionally
        and how they respond to evolving life circumstances.&quot;We live out loud
        most of the time and share our life this way, but then there are more intrinsicthings
        that happen, and our songs are part of the way we react to them. We sit down
        andbasically tell people what has happened. We certainly didn&#39;t start
        this project with aspirations tocreate the musical equivalent to great American
        literary works.&quot;After celebrating their 40th anniversary with the cleverly
        titled 2013 live album Disconnected InNew York City, the hard working, constantly
        touring band David Hidalgo, Louie Perez, CesarRosas, Conrad Lozano and Steve
        Berlin leaps headfirst into their fifth decade with an invitationto join them
        as they open fresh and exciting new Gates of Gold, their first full length
        studioalbum since 2010&#39;s Tin Can Trust (a Grammy nominee for Best Americana
        Album) and secondwith Savoy/429 Records.The dynamic songwriting, deeply poetic
        lyrics, thoughtful romantic and spiritual themes andeclectic blend of styles
        on the 11 track collection has resulted in an American saga in the richliterary
        tradition of legendary authors John Steinbeck and William Faulkner. Yet true
        to form,these typically humble musical wolves started in on the project without
        any grand vision ormusical roadmap. Over 30 years after Los Lobos&#39; major
        label breakthrough How Will The WolfSurvive? - their 1984 album that ranks
        #30 on Rolling Stones list of the 100 greatest albums ofthe 1980s their main
        challenge when they get off the road and head back into the studio is, asBerlin
        says, &quot;trying not to do stuff we&#39;ve already done. To a certain extent,
        we are alwaysdrawing from the same multi-faceted paint box, and we sound like
        what we sound like. We&#39;reproud of what we feel is an honest body of work.
        We just want to keep finding new ways to saythings.&quot;In the band&#39;s
        early recording days - those years just before and after &quot;La Bamba,&quot;
        theirworldwide crossover hit from the 1987 film which reached #1 on the U.S.
        and UK singles chart -they prepared for album recording sessions with top
        producers like T-Bone Burnett with preproductionthat included multiple rehearsals
        and &quot;outlining&quot; what the project was going to be.The more spontaneous
        approach to writing and recording that they took on their 1992 MitchellFroom
        co-produced set Kiko still exists today; Rosas says, &quot;When I listen to
        our catalog, doingthings more spontaneously in the studio has led to some
        of our best work.&quot; Unlike many bandsthat write, gather and catalog material
        between studio releases, Los Lobos prefers to create theirmagic on the fly
        when they decide it&#39;s time to record. Perez says, &quot;We never come
        in with acache of 20 songs. Our thing is to write as we&#39;re recording.
        It&#39;s like starting with a blank canvassevery time.&quot; The journey to
        Gates of Gold began with Hidalgo bringing in a batch of ideas, outlines and
        chordprogressions with no lyrics. As he and Perez began fleshing things out,
        developing grooves,melodies and lyrical themes, Hidalgo, his son, drummer
        David, Jr. and bassist Lozano begantracking those tunes. The collection opens
        with the reflective, mid-tempo rocker &quot;Made ToBreak Your Heart,&quot;
        featuring female vocalist Syd Straw, whose vibe was partially inspired byHidalgo&#39;s
        love for Manassas, the early 70s blues-country-rock band created by Stephen
        Stills.The moody, atmospheric rocker &quot;When We Were Free,&quot; whose
        lyrics of what Berlin calls&quot;beautiful melancholy memories&quot; are underscored
        with the increasing drama of booming drumsand distorted electric guitars.
        Filled with hypnotic sound effects and cool vocal and guitardistortion (created
        via an eight track analog Cascam cassette recorder!), the soulful, reflective&quot;There
        I Go&quot; touches on the universal search for what Perez calls &quot;something
        meaningful,though we&#39;re not always sure what it is.&quot;Further Hidalgo/Perez
        collaborations include &quot;Too Small Heart,&quot; a raw and raucous nod
        to bothLos Lobos garage band roots and the wild abandon of Jimi Hendrix; the
        easy grooving folkrocker&quot;Song of the Sun,&quot; which taps into the elements
        of life (water, fire, earth) and creationmyths while touching on the way we
        choose to live in the present; the slow burning blues/rocker&quot;Magdalena,&quot;
        inspired by the Biblical Mary Magdalene and visions of flowing robes; and
        thefolk-influenced, image rich rocker title track &quot;Gates of Gold,&quot;
        whose lyrical abstractions allowfor multiple earthly and spiritual interpretations.Perez
        says, &quot;When I first started listening to the original demo Dave had,
        the music spoke to meof rural America. The impression the lyrics give could
        refer to the afterlife, i.e. the &quot;pearlygates,&quot; but I also was thinking
        about the immigrant experience, the promise of a new life as onetravels across
        borders, all the thoughts a person making that daring move might have connectedto
        the dream of what America is. Our parents all wondered what lay beyond those
        gates. On apersonal level, it&#39;s a reflection of where my band mates and
        I are in our lives. We&#39;re all over 60now and looking towards the horizon
        at our own mortality. We think often about what we&#39;vecontributed and what&#39;s
        left. I don&#39;t know who the protagonist of the song is, but he&#39;s looking
        atthose gates from a distance because what lies beyond is a mystery.&quot;As
        Hidalgo and Perez began collaborating on their songs, Rosas, as per his trademark
        &quot;lonewolf&quot; songwriting approach, took his basic tracks to his home
        studio to complete the handful oftunes that flesh out the set. The singer,
        guitarist and mandolin player&#39;s pieces include the raucousand bluesy,
        garage band fired jam &quot;Mis-Treater Boogie Blues,&quot; the swampy folk-rock
        blueslament &quot;I Believed You So&quot; and the swaying, sensual Latin Cumbia-styled
        &quot;Poquito Para Aqui.&quot;The sole cover on Gates of Gold is the other
        Spanish language tune, &quot;La Tumba,&quot; an accordionlaced folk piece
        connected to the Mexican Norteno tradition (related to polka and corrodes)whose
        theme, says Perez, is very dark, &quot;about following your lover to the tomb.&quot;
        It&#39;s veryfamiliar to fans as a frequent staple of Los Lobos&#39; live
        performances.Back in 2003, when Los Lobos was celebrating the 30th Anniversary
        of their humble beginningsas a garage band in East L.A., Rolling Stone summed
        up their distinctive, diverse, freewheelingfusion of rock, blues, soul and
        Mexican folk music: &quot;This is what happens when five guys createa magical
        sound, then stick togetherto see how far it can take them.&quot; Originally
        called LosLobos del Este (de Los Angeles), a play on a popular norteno band
        called Los Lobos del Norte,the group originally came together from three separate
        units. Lead vocalist/guitarist Hidalgo,whose arsenal includes accordion, percussion,
        bass, keyboards, melodic, drums, violin and banjo, met Perez at Garfield High
        in East LA and started a garage band. Rosas, who had his own group,and Lozano
        launched a power trio. &quot;But we all hung out because we were friends and
        makingmusic was just the natural progression of things,&quot; says Perez,
        the band&#39;s drummer. &quot;Like if youhang around a barbershop long enough,
        you&#39;re going to get a haircut.&quot;Berlin is Los Lobos&#39; saxophonist,
        flutist and harmonica player who met the band while still withseminal L.A.
        rockers The Blasters. He joined the group after performing on and co-producing(with
        T-Bone Burnett) their breakthrough 1983 EP And A Time To Dance. Los Lobos
        werealready East L.A. neighborhood legends, Sunset Strip regulars and a Grammy
        winning band(Best Mexican American/Tejano Music Performance) by the time they
        recorded How Will theWolf Survive? Although the album&#39;s name and title
        song were inspired by a National Geographicarticle about real life wolves
        in the wild, the band saw obvious parallels with their struggle togain mainstream
        rock success while maintaining their Mexican roots.Perez, once called their
        powerhouse mix of rock, Tex-Mex, country, folk, R&B, blues andtraditional
        Spanish and Mexican music &quot;the soundtrack of the barrio.&quot; Three
        decades, two moreGrammys, the global success of &quot;La Bamba&quot; and thousands
        of rollicking performances acrossthe globe later, Los Lobos is surviving quite
        well -- and still jamming with the same rawintensity as they had when they
        began in that garage in 1973. They don&#39;t get in the studio asoften as
        they did a few decades ago Tin Can Trust came four years after their previous
        albumof all originals, The Town and the City but when they do, the results
        are every bit as culturallyrich, musically rocking and lyrically provocative
        as they were back in the day.&quot;It&#39;s not always the easiest thing finding
        time away from our touring schedule and families tofind time to make an album,&quot;
        says Berlin, &quot;but recording Gates of Gold, I have to say it&#39;s great
        tobe back in the proverbial saddle again. It reminds us of the fun we have
        had making new musicover the years, and it&#39;s nice to have the opportunity
        to create something of value.&quot;Perez adds, &quot;I find that the most
        interesting part of songwriting and tracking a new album is thedifferential
        between the way a song sounds to you at 2 a.m. and the way it may hit you
        when it&#39;s11 a.m. and it reaches the light of day. We may love it just
        as much or we may realize we can dobetter. It&#39;s always a process of discovering
        more about ourselves and the music we love to make.It&#39;s not always easy
        getting started again, but I love that moment in the process when the songsstart
        to take on their own life and we can let the kid, so to speak, run out onto
        the street and startfiguring things out for himself. The way songs reveal
        themselves to us during these periods ofwriting and recording is my favorite
        part of the Los Lobos recording experience.&quot;","modified":"2016-12-06
