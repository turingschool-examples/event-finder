# As a user,

# And I click Find Events, 
# The current path is `/search`,
# And I can see a list of 16 events with a header `16 events for March', sorted by popularity. 
# For each event I can see the Event name, date & time, description (shortened to 140 characters), venue name (url to the venue page), venue address.
